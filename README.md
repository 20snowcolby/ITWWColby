            <h2 id=number-1>My Birthday!</h2>
        <h6>December 11,2001</h6>
        
        <p>It was early on a Tuesday morning and the flood has started.  At Butler Memorial at 6:36 A.M. I had emerged into the world and started being awesome, I was a hefty, 7 lbs. and 10 oz. I don't remember this day as well as I remember yesterday. It probably because it was a long time ago. </p>
        
        
        
        
        
        <h2 id=number-2>My First Fist Fight</h2>
        <h6> June of 2013</h6>
        
        <p> I was sitting calmly in class after a small skirmish with a friend during lunch. I was talking to another friend and he was balling up his anger and attacked me in the middle of class. He was a lot smaller than me so I wasn’t to scared, he put his hand to my throat and I had to end it before it got to serious. I swung one punch and ended it all. Him and I never talked again. I later found out he is a farmer and lives in Nevada right now.</p>
        
        
        
        <h2 id=number-3>ROADTRIP</h2>
        <h6>July of 2019</h6>
        
        <p>Over the summer of 2019 Sean, my mom, and I went on a five-day road trip across the states of PA and NY. This was super memorable.We camped under the stars almost every night and met some great along the way. After stopping at irregular attractions, we went to Niagara Falls and Erie. My favorite part was camping in the mountains and walking the stars for hours in complete silence.</p>
